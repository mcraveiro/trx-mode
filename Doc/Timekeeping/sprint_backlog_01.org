** STARTED Generate test data files for sample project                :inner:

   :END:

Create a realistic project with a few unit tests. Things to test:

- project with more than one solution; correctly detects each solution and the
  CS projects associated with each solution.

** Download and install omnisharp                                     :outer:

We need the latest version

** Ensure build works with xunit                                      :outer:

Requires internet for nuget.

** User interface                                                     :inner:

Notes on the overall user interface for this mode.

We need the following dedicated buffers:

- tree widget: overview of all tests in project
- for each project, we need a list of available TRX files. One of these should
  be the currently loaded file. The tree should indicate when the TRX file is
  not the latest. We also need to know when we filter tests and did not run all
  tests.

*** Tree widget

Displays:

  - solutions
    - projects in solution
      - tests in project.

** Clean up folder structure                                          :outer:

Its a bit messy at the moment, we should organise it.

** Add build for Emacs                                                :outer:

We need CI for emacs so that when we push we compile and run all lisp tests.

** Add lisp skeleton                                                  :inner:

We need to add a trivial skeleton for lisp with a single function and a single
test.

** Create a simple function to read TRX XML                           :inner:

We need a very simple function to read a given file and print its contents.

** Investigate sharper code to read a solution                        :inner:

Sharper mode must already read a solution and get all of its projects. We need
to do something similar. Also check code to find all solutions and give user a
choice.

** Find out how to use icons in a widget tree                         :inner:

It would be nice to have icons for solutions and projects. There may already be
support for these with the fonts we have. It would also be nice to have icons
for green, yellow and red for tests.
